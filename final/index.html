		<p>'Punpun, back in elementary school... You wrote an essay about how your dream was to become a scientist who studies space, didn't you...'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'That takes me back...'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'I wonder,'</p>
		<p>'If the slightest accidental bump could have steered us down into such a different path in life...'</p>

	<div>
		<h3>"...What's the use in talking about pointless ifs and if nots right now?"</h3>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'Sorry'</p>

		<h3>"You're as cute as a button, Aiko."</h3>

	<div>
		<p>'I think... I love this scenery.'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'...I want to try and live on this island.'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'Living a carefree life, in a place surrounded by nature...'</p>
		<p>'I know making a living will be harder than i'm making it sound, but if we work together...'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'Even a small one-room place would be fine. And if there's a small garden, then we could try growing our own food and being self-sufficient as much as possible...'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'Rarely involving ourselves with others...'</p>
		<p>'Just living together by the sea...'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'Look...'</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>'...And if we happened to have a child,'</p>
		<p>'I'd want him or her to live a free life, not tied down by anything.'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'...on second thought,'</p>
		<p>'it'd probably be best if we didn't have a kid.'</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>'It'd be too tragic if we repeated the same mistake...'</p>
